## What is Data Analysis? ðŸ§®
In short, Data analysis is the process of finding and reporting insights in data.

### [Insights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight)
- Seeing intuitively
- Acute observation
- Discernment
- Understanding of cause and effect


In order to search, find or report intuitions or insights from data, there has to be data -Technically called `Data Gathering`.

Once the data has been successfully gathered, it has to be `cleaned` and made ready for use. 
After this stage has been passed, we are now ready to `explore` and find our intuitions.

Intuitions or `insights` can be made statistically or visually. 

Gather all your finding and make a good `report` to whoever needs it, in the form of an article for the general public, or an email to a company remote, or in slides for a presentation or in an actual report form.

#### In summary..
The process can be categorized into 5 parts
1. Gather your data
2. Clean it
3. Explore the data
4. Make good and clear visuals
5. Finally design your report to your world
