# Setup and installations

Data analysis has greatly moved from a programming language called `R` to `Python`. 
This migration happened due to the flexible libraries python has due to its growing community, making data analysis far easier.

The tool to be used for this course is `Jupyter notebook`.
It is a web application for python programming, and just as there is an ongoing migration of programming languages for data analysis, there is also a migration in [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or coding enviroments for data analysis.


Data analysis is not just about a bunch of codes written together, looking all sci-fy and complex - but a story is to be told whenever you analyse data. This concept makes use of both words of explanation and code. Similar to how a software developer of engineer will follow codes with comments as a good practice, Data analysis makes it mandatory.

Jupyter lab provides the best enviorment for story telling and coding, lets get started!

## Steps 
1. Install [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer if you are new to python. 
```
# Verify if everthing is installed properly

python --version
```

2. Install [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
```
# Run the code below in your command prompt

py -m ensurepip --upgrade

# After the installation, run the verification code

pip --version
```

3. Install `jupyter notebook`

```
# Use either of the commands below to install notebook
pip install notebook
pip install jupyter notebook
```

4. Run jupyter notebook
```
 # Run the notebook with:
 jupyter notebook
 
 # or :
 python -m notebook
```

## Congratulations âœ¨
