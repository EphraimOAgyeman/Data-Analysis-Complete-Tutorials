# Setup and installations

Data analysis has greatly moved from a programming language called `R` to `Python`. 
This migration happened due to the flexible libraries python has due to its growing community, making data analysis far easier.

The tool to be used for this course is `Jupyter notebook`.
It is a web application for python programming, and just as there is an ongoing migration of programming languages for data analysis, there is also a migration in [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or coding enviroments for data analysis.


Data analysis is not just about a bunch of codes writted together, looking all sci-fy and complex - but a story is to be told when ever you analyse. This concept makes use of both words of explanation even as you code along side. Similar to how a software developer of engineer will follow codes with comments as a good practice, Data analysis makes it mandatory.

Jupyter lab provides the best enviorment for story telling and coding, lets get started!
