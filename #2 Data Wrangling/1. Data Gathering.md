## Data Gathering

You guessed it! ðŸŽŠ
The first stage to Data Analysis is to gather data.

Data is everywhere and in different formats but can be grouped into two;
- `Existing Data` Organized data lying in storage somewhere.
- `Live Data` Data that has not been organized yet, usually yet to occur or happening live.

Before you can gather data, you have to know the purpose, ie `Problem`
