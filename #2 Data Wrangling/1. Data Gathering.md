## Data Gathering

You guessed it! ðŸŽŠ
The first stage to Data Analysis is to gather data.

Data is everywhere and in different formats but can be grouped into two;
- `Existing Data` Organized data lying in storage somewhere.
- `Live Data` Data that has not been organized yet, usually yet to occur or happening live.

Before you can gather data, you have to know the purpose, ie `Problem`. 
Imagine the numerous websites with data, databases around the world and data on social media as sample examples of sources of data, likened unto a haystack.
Finding particular data without a problem is like looking for particular strands in the large haystack.

> You must have the problem put in a statement - clear! not ambigious.
