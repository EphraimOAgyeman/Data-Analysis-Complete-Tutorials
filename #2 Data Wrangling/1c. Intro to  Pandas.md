## This is the continuation

### Our target 🎓
* Import downloaded data - [Bike_trip_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7969SsIB5Y2Iu5umJacoLC9xQMQQnnI/view?usp=sharing)
* Next - Access the data

> NOTE: Follow the instructions in the [previous lesson](https://github.com/EphraimOAgyeman/Data-Analysis-Complete-Tutorials/blob/70b138f1c4bc7daa0a7c7b489189f62dbb3f8711/%232%20Data%20Wrangling/1b.%20Data%20Gathering%20Programatically.md) to learn to import the data into jupyter labs

## Introduction to `pandas`
<img src = "Images/pandas.png"> 

The piece of code above is divided into three parts
* Importing Pandas
* Finding the dataset and placing it into a variable using pandas
* Displaying the dataset

### `Pandas` 
This is the first library you will learn and use in data analysis and artificial intelligence.

It is a library specialized in dealing with data in the following ways; 
1. Gathering data -also known as wrangling data 🤠, as a cowboy would wrangle up the cattle. 
2. Storing and updating data
3. Cleaning data
4. Accessing data/ looking into data 🔍

### Steps in using pandas

Import pandas in your workspace. Copy the code below...
```
import pandas as pd
```
`pd` is short for pandas, which serves as a personal copy of the pandas class somewhere for you to use to your content.

Now that you have a copy of pandas as `pd`, lets use one of the powers hidden in pandas `read_csv()`. This is a function made inside pandas to help you access data, so you don't have to code it yourself 😆. Great right!

```
pd.read_csv("bike_trip_data.csv")
```
Lets have our code in a variable / container, so that it can be carried easily - else you have to repeat `pd.read_csv("bike_trip_data.csv")` every time you need to work with your data, which is all the time by the way 🙂.

This part it entirely up to you.
```
bike_data = pd.read_csv("bike_trip_data.csv")
```

> NOTE: This approach is slightly different from the very image at the top. I had to switch from Jupyter labs for some technical reasons, so don't follow the image! Thank you 😅


## Viewing the data
```
bike_data.head()
```
We refer to `bike_data` since it contains our actual data. Data is treated like wood 🪵, having a head and tail.
Saying you want just the head will display just the first five(5) records or rows. Using tails will give you the last five(5) too.
