## We assess by inspecting our data for 2 things;


*   Quality
> Issues with content; Missing, Duplicate, Incorrect data - **Dirty Data**
Basically, anytime humans are involved, there's going to be alot of data with errors.
*   Tidiness
> Structural Issues - **Messy Data**
Messy data is usually the result of poor data planning.


We assess in two stages;

Visualy - With your eyes
Programatically - Using code
When you find an issue, document it, to make cleaning easier

for both dirty - bad data and messy - bad structure
